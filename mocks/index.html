            <p>Ending the year as a Heisman candidate for the Michigan Wolverines, the Jaguars will look to add a top edge rusher to pair with young stud DE Josh Allen. Alabama LT Evan Neal seemed to be the favorite to go #1 overall, with the franchise tag being placed on Cam Robinson, it appears the Jaguars will go in a different direction.</p>

The Detroit Lions are in a prime position to get their guy and mold his raw talent into a franchise QB. It is becoming more and more evident that a franchise QB is necessary to accomplish any sustained success in the NFL, and the Lions get their guy here at pick #2.</p>

            <p>The New York Jets have not shied away from drafting the athletic freak at the tackle position before, evidenced by their selection of Mekhi Becton a few years ago. Becton hasn’t exactly been the player the Jets were hoping he would be, and it is well known that GM Joe Douglas likes to beef up on the O-Line, so the Jets take another athletic freak here at #4.</p>

            <p>The New York Giants have prioritized improving their offensive line this offseason, signing C John Felicano and G Mark Glowinski. LT Andrew Thomas had a good sophomore season, but the Giants give him a partner in Evan Neal, who new offensive line coach Bobby Johnson, can place on either Daniel Jones’ right or left side.</p>

            <p>It has been reported that the Carolina Panthers would be willing to reach at this pick as long as it meant that they would be able to select an offensive tackle. In this case, they decide to take their guy in QB Kenny Pickett. As I mentioned before, QB is too important of a position to pass up on. After not landing Deshaun Watson or Russell Wilson in the trade market, the Panthers opt to get a younger, cheaper option. </p>

            <p>Coming from the Buffalo Bills system, the new regime of GM Joe Schoen and Head Coach Brian Daboll know how important it is to have an elite safety patrolling their secondary, in this case, two of them, with Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. Here at pick #7, the Giants get a player who some are labeling as a “generational talent”, only falling because of positional value.</p>

            <p>The Baltimore Ravens attempted to reunite with edge rusher Za’Darius Smith during this free agency period, but contract negotiations fell through, with Smith signing with the Vikings instead. The Ravens add the talented Johnson to their defensive line unit, and now have a nice pair of young edge rushers for the future in Johnson and Odafe Oweh.</p>

            <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are one of the more complete rosters in the NFL, and they add depth to their EDGE group. Jason Pierre-Paul is currently still a free agent so the Buccaneers here look to get younger and cheaper at that position.</p>

            <p>Ojabo’s slide stops at pick #29, finding himself with the Green Bay Packers. Ojabo, who was once a projected top-15 pick, tragically tore his achilles at his pro day, which will unfortunately make him fall in the draft. With the loss of Za’Darius Smith, the Packers choose to have Ojabo take a redshirt year to learn behind Preston Smith and Rashan Gary.</p>

            <p>The Chiefs lost both Mike Hughes and Charvarius Ward in free agency, so they decide to take a CB with a lot of upside in Kaiir Elam. With the influx of talent being added to the AFC West, the Chiefs will have to continue to make upgrades to their defense and their secondary especially.</p>

            <p>The Detroit Lions get somewhat of a steal with Karlaftis falling all the way to to pick #32. The Lions get a player to add to their EDGE depth who will work to become a starter in sure time. Karlaftis has a high motor and will never stop working on a play, something that Dan Campbell and his staff will undoubtedly appreciate. </p>
